# Top-Dishes-Zomato
-Going through restaurant reviews on Zomato to find good dishes can be quite difficult. 
-Reviewers use colloquial terms for the dishes instead of actual menu names. 
-A user can read a review recommending a tasty dish, but it is difficult to map this to a particular menu item offered by the restaurant.
-We will use translated version of Zomatoâ€™s dataset (English to Hindi)-this includes data of menu of restaurants and reviews on Zomato
-Our goal is to create a model to identify food mentions and match them up with menu items. 
-If a match is made, the review is rated as a positive, negative, or neutral description of the menu item. 
-This can be aggregated to prices and locations and presented to a restaurant-goer.
