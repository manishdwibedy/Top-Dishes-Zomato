Even though Awadhi cuisine is quite popular in this part of the world, only a few have managed to get the preparation right or keep the distinct taste intact.Few days back, during a chance visit to Malviya Nagar, I discovered a small colorful restaurant, which by a strange coincidence is named the Kebab Gali. Not knowing what to expect, I made a hurried entry to enquire about their menu. To my surprise, the Kebab Gali offers a great assortment of authentic kebabs such as Dahi Ke Kebabs, Dohra Kebabs, and Galouti Kebabs. Usually made with minced meat and mild spices and served as appetizers, these kebabs taste heavenly with chutneys and dips. The elaborate spread at Kebab Gali brought back vivid memories of my last visit to Lucknow. The capital city of the state of Uttar Pradesh is hailed for popularizing the Awadhi cuisine, particularly dishes like kebabs, biryanis, kormas, kaliyas, nahari kulchas, zarda, roomali rotis, warqi parathas, and sheermal.In this blog post, I'm going to list my favorite dishes at the Kebab Gali.Vegetarian StartersDahi Ke Kebabs[My rating: 5 out of 5]When it comes to crunchy vegetarian kebabs, Dahi Ke Kebabs still rules the roost. Made from hung curd, cheese, onions, ginger, and pepper, these delectable soft kebabs are a must-have.Paneer Tikka[My rating: 3 out of 5]A classic alternative to chicken tikka, this dish is perfect for those who love chunks of grilled paneer marinated in Indian spices. Made in clay ovens (tandoors) or Indian pans (greased tawa), this popular North Indian starter is scrumptious in every bite. Stuffed Mushroom Tikka[My rating: 4.5 out of 5]Perhaps the tastiest starter for vegans, the Stuffed Mushroom Tikkas are succulent button mushroom caps filled with finely chopped bell peppers and paneer. Tastes best when served piping hot with lemon wedges and onions.Non-vegetarian StartersDohra Kebab[My rating: 3 out of 5]A chef special kebab, Dohra Kebab contains a layer of mutton mince topped with chicken mince, roasted in a tandoor till perfectly cooked. Served with mint chutney and onions, these juicy kebabs contain a mélange of flavors. Fish Fry[My rating: 5 out of 5]A battered fried fish that is soft from inside and crunchy from outside. You couldn't possibly ask for anything better!Galouti Kebab with Warqi Paratha[My rating: 4 out of 5]The literal meaning of the word 'Galouti' is 'melt in the mouth'. In the ancient days, Galouti Kebabs used to be prepared in the royal kitchens of the ageing Nawabs of Lucknow (since they faced difficulty in chewing). In its modern-day avatar, these delicious, mouth-watering kebabs are served with multilayered soft parathas called Warqi. Chicken Kasturi Tikka[My rating: 4 out of 5]As the name implies, these 'roasted to perfection' chicken tikkas are marinated overnight with Kasturi Methi, which lends the perfect divine flavor for your palate.Chicken Khurchan[My rating: 5 out of 5]First look and you think it sure looks like Tacos, but Chicken Khurchan is essentially spicy chicken grilled with onions and bell peppers wrapped in mini rotis. With a taste that cannot be compared with anything else, Chicken Khurchan is beyond doubt the best signature dish at Kebab Gali.Vegetarian Main CourseDal Makhani[My rating: 5 out of 5]Craving for the perfect Dal Makhani made from whole black lentils, red kidney beans, butter, and cream, then this is the dish you should be going after. And while you're at it, don't forget to order some Mirchi Parathas.Non-vegetarian Main CourseMutton Nihari[My rating: 3 out of 5]This hot spicy curry is one of the national dishes of Pakistan. Garnished to taste and best paired with butter naans, the Mutton Nihari is all set to chase away your wintry blues.Lazeez Murgh Handi[My rating: 3 out of 5]Served with hot tandoori rotis, this delicious curry dish contains succulent pieces of chicken soaked in tomato gravy with coarsely ground garam masala, onions, coriander and red chilies.Fish Curry[My rating: 4 out of 5]Dig into this sinful and flavorsome fish curry, made healthy by cooking in less oil. Best enjoyed with tandoori naan, rumali roti, or lacha paratha.Biryanis (Vegetarian/Non-vegetarian)[My rating: 5 out of 5]Beyond doubt this was the pick of the bunch for me. The rice and meat are cooked separately and then layered in an earthen pot (handi) before cooking with steam (dum). To ensure the flavors and aroma remain intact, the pot is sealed with dough. Available in three different variants - chicken, mutton, and vegetarian - this biryani tastes best with gravy and raita.Desserts Gajar ka halwa[My rating: 5 out of 5]Popularly known as Gajrela, this sweet dessert is made with grated carrots, condensed milk, and sugar. Khoya, cardamom powder, and nuts are added to elevate the flavor.Gulab jamun[My rating: 4 out of 5]Made of milk powder, yogurt, sugar, and water, these fried dumplings taste heavenly when dipped in rose scented sugar syrup.Like me, if you're also a fan of flame-cooked Awadhi dishes served from behind a counter, then make sure to visit the newly opened Kebab Gali as soon as you can.”        ],"res_id": [          18161584        ],"id": "2"},{"review_text": [          “Kebab Gali is a must try restaurant if you are a kebab lover located at corner market malviya nagar offering  North Indian, Mughlai cuisines and Biryani as there speciality.Nice ambience with seating available for 25-30 people, service, hospitality is very good and portions served were very good.Drinks- Aam Panna and Jal Jeera (Recommended)Now coming to food,Starters:Dhai ke kebab, very soft .

Interiors of this place are not that good but the sheer quality of their food will definitely make yu fall in love with this place. We had-Aam panna: it tasted good but could have been a bit colder.Jaljeera: Superb. Completely different from the ordinary jal jeera. Do not miss it if yu are visiting Kebab Gali.Dahi Kebab: i'm a sucker for dahi kebabs and have to say their's were unlike any dahi kebabs i've eaten everywhere else. Supersoft..having curd in a perfect balance. These are HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.Shikhampuri Kebab: this one is basically a hara bhara kebab with a twist. The twist is that it is filled with cheese in its centre. This combo worked wonders for my taste buds. RECOMMENDEDPaneer Tikka: i do not like paneer tikka in general but theirs was good.Galouti kebab served with warqi parantha: right from the presentation to its taste everything was just too good. Simply yet attractive and tasty. Check out the pic. RECOMMENDEDMushroom Tikka: kudos to the chef for this little wonder. Served in a round point shovel..yeah a shovel..those little button mushrooms tasted too good to be true. Overall, i have to say i tried five of their starters and literally loved all of them. Those starters raised my expectations to an insanely high level. Then we ordered the main course, in which we had-Dal makhani: thick gravy, lots of aroma..served in a mini steel bucket, this was also good but it has somewhat orange colour which dal makhani usually doesn't have.Paneer butter Masala: paneer pieces were soft and the gravy was spicy. Found it tastier than dal makhani. Lacha parantha: this could have been better as its sides were burnt but the curries i was eating it with were so good it didn't really matter.Veg biriyani: i had only a few spoons as i was so almost full by now. But you will tell how good that biryani was just by the rich smell of it.In desserts, they have just three options..we tried them all..Gulab jamun: regular ones..just as you would find anywhere else.Cheeni Makhmali Parantha: now this one's a dessert for diabetic ones( :p ). This parantha was filled with makhan and had a hint of cheeni here and there. Liked it.Shahi tukda: amazing. Loved it. Have a sweet tooth, go for it..yu wont be disappointed.Overall i have to say, it is quite rare that yu find almost everything that you eat at particular restro, so good. Their starters are so good, yu cant give them a miss. And it would be a sin if i forgot to mention that in such minimal prices they serve real big quantities. For an average guy, one full plate of any of their items is enough. Also they serve superfast. I found this place so good, i have to give it full 5 rating,and definitely gonna come back here soon..”],"res_id": [          18161584        ],"id": "6"},{"review_text": [          “Ordered online, chicken tandoori momos, mutton biryani and shawarma. Momos - 3.5/5 Shawarma - 3/5Mutton Biryani - 1/5 (Suggest not to order this dish ever)Delivery - 3/5Overall - Not a great experience...”],"res_id": [          18161584        ],"id": "7"},{"review_text": [          “wow loved the food and who like available averting all about the food and drinks really cool place I com with my new friend and me good place...”],"res_id": [          18161584        ],"id": "8"},{"review_text": [          “Kebab Gali is one of my absolute favourites! It's very easy to give this tiny restaurant a miss but just look carefully. This is not a joint you want to overlook. I was casually skimming through restaurant options for dinner in Malviya Nagar when this popped up. I saw the positive reviews and got curious. So I went ahead and ordered the recommended foods and boy, was I in for a great treat! I ordered the much celebrated dahi kababs along with dal makhni, mutton Galouti kababs with warqi paranthas. On a separate day I decided to take my food loving friends there and got to try their chicken korma, sheer mall, chicken dum biryani. Everything was so well made! Please, whatever you do, take out some time for their beautiful dahi kababs! Such soft, melt-in-your mouth vegetarian delights! I'm not a big fan of vegetarian food but this is always on the menu for me. Their dal makhni is creamy and has a nice velvety softness- another delightful treat. One of those few places that gets the dal makhni right. Special mention goes to their sweet warqi paranthas which provide a good balanced taste to go with the heavy, spicy, meaty (non veg ones) Galouti kababs. Their chicken korma and sheer malls are also pretty decent. Chicken shawarma also deserves a special mention although it doesn't have mayonnaise (since shawarmas aren't supposed to have mayonnaise). But I do think they should work on their shawarma a little more. Their biryani is AWESOME. They served it in a beautiful earthen pot and it really retains its aroma and flavour. Do not miss the special biryani! Very prompt delivery and very reasonably priced food. And you'll be happy with the quantity as well. This easily makes it to my favourites list. Try it!

Kebab gali stands out in this arena. Located in the malviya nagar corner market, very close to the metro station. Kebab gali serves some of the most lipsmacking and authentic kebabs that I have ever tasted. There menu has a variety of kebabs as well as biryani both vegetarian and non-vegetarian and that too at a very affordable cost.The ambiance of the place is set to give you the feel of the royalty of the mughal era, with stone lamps and wall tapestry. The servers are also very sweet and humble and the service was very quick. Coming to the food, for starters I had their very famous Dahi ke kebab. The kebabs were crisp and well cooked from the outside and delectable and soft from the inside. Served with mint chutney and onion , it made a greater starter. Next, I had the Double seekh kebab, the dohra kebab, this dish is very unique to kebab gali as this is in the form of concentric shells. The outer layer of meat has a different flavor and color as compared to the inner meat, giving you the feeling of a two in one combination. I have never had such a unique dish and it was enjoyed thoroughly. Then came the game changer, The galaoti Kebabs with ulte tawa ka paratha. The parathas was cut to one-fourth their size and a kebab was placed on top of each quarter, full score for presentation here! The galaoti kebabs contained the true essence of the dish and were actually melting in mouth. Full justice was done to the kebabs. Utterly soft and succulent minced meat. The paratha was also cooked to perfection , crisp but not too chewy. I also tried the panner tikka, all the vegetarians in town, this is the place to go for well marinated and good quality panner tikkasFor the main course I first had their mutton biryani . Absolutely loved the way this was served. The biryani came in a claypot in which it was cooked, sealed with flour. This gave it the true authentic Awadhi taste and appearance. The aroma of the biryani was bang on an each and every grain of good quality basmati that was used was very flavourful.I also tried their dal makhnai and buuter chicken. Both were very rich, cooked to perfection and made an absolutely incredible combination with the fluffy and crisp butter naans that were served.Ending on a sweet note I tried their gulab jamuns. They were served piping hot and tasted delectable dipped in the well prepared sugar syrup. I also had their phirni which was served in small earthern claypots. This gave the earthen aroma and the true authentic flavor to it. My overall experience in kebab gali was absolutely wonderful. Great food, great ambiance and to top everything, the prices and also well within the budget. This place is highly recommended and a visit atleast once should be made.”],"res_id": [          18161584        ],"id": "14"},{"review_text": [          “Kebab gali is close by to the Hauz Khas metro station, approximately 10 minutes and can be located on the main road. The red and yellow banner in beautiful calligraphy can be spotted from a distance. The insides are decent and clean of any pretence ( as shown in the photos). The decor is very ethnic inspired and will remind you of dining in a cosy little parlour of the olden times.I reached here in the evening and was presented with a great choice of starters.We chose the following dishes for starters :1. Dahi ke kebab : The texture was crisp on the outside and soft on the inside with the mild blend of spices making the dish irresistible.2. Paneer tikka : This was a decent dish with the paneer silky soft and marinated well.3. Mutton galouti kebab : This dish was the one that began my impressive journey. It was very soft and juicy and I ate it without the paratha with no other additions.4. Dohra kebab : This is truly the star of the day for me. The succulent meat in meat is a combination that not many get right but somehow kebab Gali impressed me a lot.5. Chicken garlic tikka : Another good dish which was given a very interesting presentation with the chicken bots well done and completely marinated.Now let's move in to the main course. As impressive as the starters were, my expectations of the main course were truly high and I must say I wasn't disappointed.1. Vegetarian biryani : the fragrant rice with the spicy vegetables making a perfect combination had me reach for the handi twice even though I had a lot more dishes coming.2. Chicken biryani : this dish was slightly off point for me. While the chicken was certainly cooked, the rice was not as good in texture and taste as the veg counterpart.3. Dal makhani : the dal, although good in taste, lacked the zing and a little more ginger or some equivalent could have made it more intriguing.4. Achari paneer : Another lovely dish to complement about. The taste and texture of the paneer was a simple foodgasm not many dishes can achieve.5. Mutton nihari : A very nice dish with the mutton literally falling off the bones. I judge my meat on how it falls off the bones as this one was a winner.6. Chicken korma : another dish I must commend. It was very nicely made with the taste just right and complementary to the accompanying breads.The accompanying assorted breads included mirchi paratha and garlic naan both of which I really liked. We also tried the sheermal and the taste is definitely worth a visit. It will balance and spice completely and pairing it with nihari will be pure bliss for any Foodie. The beautifully Gali of tandoori dishes finally ended with a serving of gulab jamun and phirni. I am not much of a phirni fan though my friends went gaga over it but the gulab jamun was the perfect sweet ending I could have asked for the visit.Final rating :Ambiance : 4Food : 4.5Drinks : 4Service : 4.5”],"res_id": [          18161584        ],"id": "15"},{"review_text": [          “Located at the end of corner market there is a kebab gali which serves delicious Indian cuisine.The are having beautiful infrastructure and good ambience.But they are having very less space.They can't accommodate 3 or 4 families at same time.Their service is very fast.They serves both veg as well as non veg.I can't tell about the taste of non veg but their presentation was superb.Presentation was tempting me to eat non veg but I controlled myself.Now coming to vegetarian itemsAs expected in starters they served paneer tikka which was good.They have not experimented with paneer tikka.But they don't need to do as it is evergreen starter.Now it's the turn of dahi kabab.I have tried them for the first time.People who are fond of crispy food wouldn't like it much.You can't it with fork as filling of these kabab is with dahi which is liquid.They were very oily also.So not recommend for fitness freak person.That's all for viggie.Main course consist of dal makhni,martbaan paneer,dahi.Martbaan paneer is sort of shahi paneer served in Martbaan.Somewhat flavours of pickles were coming while eating Martbaan paneer.Dal makhni was best.It was creamier ,thick and full of flavours.Then comes veg and non veg biryani.I liked the way they served biryani.Veg biryani was good.It was full of flavours.We can feel the taste of each and every vegetable desperately.Rice was not sticky.Coming to breads,I firstly tried SHEERMAAL.This was new to me.In simple word you can say it as sweet thick roti.SHEERMAAL was quite think.Personally I didn't like it.Mirch prantha was good.It was crisp and spicy too.Naan was also good.It was full of butter.The thing I liked the most is it was not rubber like thing.It was easily chewable.Now comes the desert.They are having firni and gulab jamun in their menu.Firni was full of dry fruits.

I found the texture quite good and smooth as it should be and taste is also delicious. Next dish is the the dohra kebab, which has both chicken as well as mutton in it. The kebab looks vibrant and colourful ans tastes okay. Next in line is chicken garlic tikka which by the name you can guess has good influence of garlic in it which makes the taste even better.As we move towards main course, i awaited the dum biryani. Dum is a technique which is used to lock the flavours of the rice by not letting the steam by through. The biryani is deliciously cooked and the rice in the biryani are yummy. Overall , biryani is one of the best dishes here. Next part is for those having a sweet tooth so read carefully, i tried the phirni and the gulab jamun.

The bits of Chilly in it gives an extra punch. ??Paneer Tikka: Nothing extraordinary about it, nicely done just how a good Tikka should be.?Dohra Kebab: The star of their menu, delicious Chicken seek is wrapped around spicy flavourful Mutton seek. Two of the best Kebabs in one bite. Awesome.??Mutton Galauti Kebab: The Galauti Served here is quite good. Melt in the mouth and spicy.?Chicken Garlic Tikka: Strong Garlic flavour, soft Chicken but needs a bit improvement.?Dal Makhni: They do justice to the most fav Indian dish. Creamy, Mildly Spiced and thick.??Martaban Paneer: A different dish to try. A bit tangy but overall a nice one.?Biriyani: Chicken Biriyani was what we ordered. Fine aromatic rice, not so spicy with soft Chicken pieces. Good. ??Firni was just good, had much better and Gulabjamun also was fine enough...”],"res_id": [          18161584        ],"id": "21"},{"review_text": [          “Fantastic place for kebab Lovers. The place has amazing combinations for both vegetarians and non veg. The biryani is worth trying as well. I went for dine in but I was amazed to see the delivery orders that the place was doing.

Maybe it's their Vasant Kunj Branch which I will try out for the Dahi Kebabs.Veg Galouti with the Parantha was still Fine in taste.In the Main Course, We had Balti Dal Makhni which I found to be quite Smooth in Taste & was somewhat different from the usual! Martaban Paneer was Spicy & to my taste! The Gravy had Hari Mirchi ka Achaar & went well with the Crispy Mirchi ka Parantha & Butter Garlic Naan! Sheer Mal which is a Persian Bread was too Thick Dripping with Ghee.I could taste a lot of Elaichi but No Kesar whatsoever - to be avoided if you're going here.Handi Biryani is another big NO as I found the Flattened Rice used was Undercooked & Not much Flavour in the Biryani whatsoever! Finished off with Cold Phirni which was quite Decent topped with Almonds & Grated Pista, Gulab Jamun can also be Tried out :)..”],"res_id": [          18161584        ],"id": "23"},{"review_text": [          “From scintillating aroma filling up your nostrils to the heavenly look of food. your mind goes into a dream for the feel of that butter chicken melting away in your mouth.This is located in Malviya Nagar Corner market, there are a lot of small eateries in and around the market and one might get confused too where to go but if you know kebab gali this is the place to be.A small pot with roses and rose petals greeted me as I entered. the area looked small with about 25 seats. the place was bright with positive vibes also there were a lot of mirrors on the wall not only it makes a place look rich but also it has a Vaastu Connect.For the starters we had "Dahi ke kebab", "Dohre Kebab "The dahi ke kebabs were unusually soft and the Dohre kebabs were the best thing I've ever tasted it was mutton seekh kebab covered on the outside with chicken seekh kebab.The food was delicious the place has a positive vibe about it. Come on a date or with family you will be satisfied. And finding food that satisfies your taste palettes in today's time is hard.Thanks Kebab Gali will visit all your outlets soon...”],"res_id": [          18161584        ],"id": "24"},{"review_text": [          “I dont know why this is in Zomato brilliant biryanis ! That was the worst order - some spicy hard rice with some hard chicken added separately! The balti meat was nice - tender mutton that tasted like laal maas. The chicken tandoori n roomali roti too were decent. Chhach was OK. But wonder why theres no green salad on the menu ?...”],"res_id": [          18161584        ],"id": "25"}
