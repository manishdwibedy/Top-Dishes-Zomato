The place is very popular and you might have to wait more than half an hour even on weekdays. Its a fine dining restaurant with comfortable seating arrangement. Staff of Gulati knows their jobs very well. Servers are attentive and courteous. Manager is friendly and take good care of its costumers. Coming to the food, they serve the best butter Chicken I have ever had. They have other specialities too. Dahi ke kabab is also one of the best in delhi. Rarha mutgh, murgh tikka masala and chicken khurchan are also must try. For vegetarians, best and must try dish is malai kofta. It have a rich creamy gravy which makes it very delicious. Place is obviously not economical. Pandara road is known for its luxury dining. They also have buffet at lunch time.. A must try place for every one. Highly reccomended..",    "res_id": [              799            ],    "id": "26"    },{"review_text":"Hit The Follow button For love !! The world needs a lot of love !!Since I was a tiny kid the only place where we went for a celebration or to enjoy as such was - Gulati ! It is like the ever favorite of the world ! When I say world - It means India :P I will not do my conventional review of the place. Will try to get in the depths though.I went for the buffet. It was during Lohri time. So I had the punjabi buffet. Everything was pretty much basic north indian food , because well it is punjabi ! The butter chicken was yummy ! All the breads were soft !! The soups were amazing ! Paneer was good. The pooris were nice and warm. Everything was good.Nothing stood out at such but nothing needed to be. It is Gulati , it runs on tradition more ! The ambiance of the place is absolutely same to a hindi movie restaurant. Looks same to same. Surreal and peaceful.Service is good and helpful. They are part of the tradition as well I guess.In the end I would say go for an anniversary meal or good time with your folks","res_id": [          799        ],"id": "27"},{"review_text": "Gulati - a name synonymous to north Indian and muglai delicacies. Known for its butter chicken and naan, it doesnt disappoint vegetarians. Good options for both veg and non veg. Checked into this place yesterday for navratras thali.

One of the common liking restaurant of my family. It was the day when Ind won by 1 run from Bangladesh. At first i was not eager to visit this place as i wanted something different and felt i would be totally bored out of the same food and taste again.This is one place where people wait for hours to get a seat and dont make a fuss out of it (Till that time the kulfi wala makes merry out of the customers :)) Once we got in and sat, we were following the match till the last ball and the food was server after that. So i guess it tasted way better coz' of the win.When we started tasting each dish, it was amazing. It was like they have surpassed their own standards and tastes. dahi kebabs, mutton burra, rogan gosht, chicken, paneer, dal all tasted soooooo awsome. I actually took the dal bucket and finished it off (what was left of it).Thanks for such a lovely treat Gulati's.","res_id": [          799        ],"id": "29"},{"review_text": "We went to this place with 6-7 friends for a birthday.

We chose the latter and ordered a vegetarian hyderabadi biryani, veg Galouti kebab, phalsa shikanji and aam panna.Their biryani is to die for. From bite one untill the last, this is one dish of pure indulgence. A must eat at gulati, and undoubtedly the best in town. Next, the galouti kebabs were huge in size and soft and tender. Drinks were fine but a little too sweet which leaves a room for a bit of improvements. Service was fine, a little slow though given it was a weekend.

The managers are always taking your feedback. #price : 3, Expensive. What used to be student joint can now only be afforded by upper middle class families. The food no doubt is great but considering the hassles of parking, its not really justified #food : 4.5.The onions and chutney are a treat in itself. #butterchicken : Heavenly. Thats the only word to describe it. Well made with good cream and fresh meat. Must try if you are here.
